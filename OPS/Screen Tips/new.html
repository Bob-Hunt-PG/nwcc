    <p class="page-lead">As you search for truth, never forget that God has an individual plan for your life that includes a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. That plan may be discovered in the Bible, God&rsquo;s personal message to each of us. We teach and preach from the Bible and stand firmly upon it&rsquo;s truth to change lives and offer hope.</p>

    <p class="page-lead">Growing in grace is just that; a growth process. Just like a garden, your faith has to be firmly planted, fed, watered, and given plenty of &ldquo;Son&rdquo; light. And like any process, it takes time and patience to realize a harvest. Don&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself. Everyone is growing in grace.</p>
