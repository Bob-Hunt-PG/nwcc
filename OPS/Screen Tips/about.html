    <p class="page-lead">The New Winchester Christian Church has a long and rich history in the Hendricks County area. Founded in 1862, NWCC is an independent Christian church that stands firmly upon the Bible as God&rsquo;s Word. While independent of any denominational hierarchy, we fellowship with many churches that hold the same belief concerning our faith and practice. Our services are designed to uplift, encourage, and grow the family of faith. We believe that every Christian is someone very special and holds great value in the eyes of God. While the immediate ministry of the NWCC might be central Indiana, we support missions work around the world.</p>
